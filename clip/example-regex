#
# The idea here is to allow a stack for each name
# this will be stored in name@d under files named
# name@d/name@43
# with name symlinked to name@d/name@n
# where n is the number of the newest
# we can also allow named saving, so name@flibble
# by putting to name@flibble



f() { [[ "$1" =~ ^[+%-]?[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+(@[0-9]+)?$ ]] && echo yes || echo no ; }

#f() { [[ "$1" =~ ^[+%-] ]] && echo yes || echo no ; }
t() { echo "trying '$2' expecting $1, got $(f "$2")" ; }
t yes hello
t no yell.o
t yes +flibble
t yes -flibble
t no \*flibble
t yes flibble@45
t yes %flibble


## having said that, write put and get in Python, then we can make much more elaborate syntaxes.
